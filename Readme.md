# Dancebots Electronics HW and Firmware Repository

Here, you will find the PCB design data, ATTiny firmware, and additional hardware information, such as the BOM below.

For the Desktop Dancebots Editor source code, please refer to [its repository](https://github.com/philippReist/dancebots_gui).

## Required Software
KiCAD version 7.0 was used to generate the schematic and PCB design (v.8.3).

## Hardware BOM

The bill of materials is available [~~here~~](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H4aylC6xcZu8uulw1L1Zao0gHDbFx3T0). 


## Dancebots PCB
In the subfolder ```dancebots_pcb```, you will find the [KiCAD](https://www.kicad-pcb.org/) design files, along with the Gerber files that you may use to manufacture the PCBs.

## Firmware
The move and LED commands embedded in the right channel of the MP3 files generated with the Dancebots Editor are parsed by an Microchip ATTinyX61A running the firmware in ```DancebotsFirmware```. Refer to the readme contained in that folder for more information.

## Programming PCB
The subfolder ```ATTiny-ProgrammingBoard``` contains the design files for a simple PCB that helps programming ATTiny microcontrollers in larger quantities.

## Solder Exercise PCB
The subfolder ```solder-ex-pcb``` contains the design files for a simple PCB that can be used as a soldering exercise board for children/people wanting to learn how to solder. It may also allow learning to infer a very simple schematic from a PCB by looking at traces or running conductivity tests on the PCB. Finally, it provides inputs for the battery pack and an output header that may be used for intermediate PCB testing when teaching the Dancebots workshop.
